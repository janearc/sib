short guidance
---
* If you start taking notes on something, put it somewhere public. Default to
  maximum visibility and justify each successive level of privacy. *Why* are
  you *hiding* something?
* If your default method for "taking notes" is a non-free, non-open application,
  *you* are the problem, not the tool; *learn* to use markdown and revision
  control. Literally millions of other people have. Get better at it. It's not
  "hard."
* Stop saying "let's take this off-line." What results is a private, back-channel
  conversation that happens off the record. Nobody knows what happened there.
  Often, major decisions are either made "off-line" or *justified* "off-line",
  and both the decision and the justification are equally important.
* Call fewer meetings. Things that happen in meatspace are not "greppable."
  They are not archived. They are not hyperlinked. They are not revision-
  controlled. If you must have a meeting, take notes (see above). Coordinate
  the meeting with people both physically in a space and remotely, so that
  you are responsible to the remote people for providing a clear, archived
  record of what happened (slack is your friend).
* Stop saying "this might be better on a call" and "could you call me?" Anything
  you need to be able to communicate in the office can be communicated via
  email. If you are concerned you will "come across wrong," *the problem is you.*
  If you find yourself frequently (or even infrequently) in this position,
  change the way you communicate.
* Stop "[wikilawyering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikilawyering)."
  Communicate clearly. Be unambiguous. Say what you mean. Ask for what you want.
  Not doing so leads people to carve off "silos" and "fiefdoms" to "protect"
  themselves or their cohort from other people who purport to speak from
  authority. The less authority is invoked, the more comfortable people will be
  speaking frankly, or indeed at all. More comfort leads to more openness.
  &hellip;which leads to less secrecy.
* Commit to taxonomies and ontologies. Often, especially in government and
  organisations that have a lot of "administrative baggage" or a long history
  build up systems that make it difficult to find things, even very important
  policies. This can be used as a lever by small groups of people to assert
  control through secrecy over larger groups of people. Commit to placing
  all documents, records of decicions, and internal history in a flat-as-possible,
  easily-searched, regularly-and-intelligently-indexed hierarchy of documents.
  When someone wishes to know why a thing is done or why it exists, it should
  not be an effort to find the document supporting it.
* Resist "organisational knowledge." Akin to "cargo-cult" practices, organisational
  knowledge happens when a group perpetuates an activity for the sole reason of
  having always done it "that way." Instead, try to make it easier for everyone
  to understand, at all times, why anything is being done. If there is sunlight
  on everything, there are few if any chances for motivations to be hidden;
  these hidden motivations often include such ugliness as bigotry and nepotism.
