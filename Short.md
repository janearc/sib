short guidance
---
* If you start taking notes on something, put it somewhere public. Default to
  maximum visibility and justify each successive level of privacy. *Why* are
  you *hiding* something?
* If your default method for "taking notes" is a non-free, non-open application,
  *you* are the problem, not the tool; *learn* to use markdown and revision
  control. Literally millions of other people have. Get better at it. It's not
  "hard."
* Stop saying "let's take this off-line." What results is a private, back-channel
  conversation that happens off the record. Nobody knows what happened there.
  Often, major decisions are either made "off-line" or *justified* "off-line",
  and both the decision and the justification are equally important.
* Call fewer meetings. Things that happen in meatspace are not "greppable."
  They are not archived. They are not hyperlinked. They are not revision-
  controlled. If you must have a meeting, take notes (see above). Coordinate
  the meeting with people both physically in a space and remotely, so that
  you are responsible to the remote people for providing a clear, archived
  record of what happened (slack is your friend).
* Stop saying "this might be better on a call" and "could you call me?" Anything
  you need to be able to communicate in the office can be communicated via
  email. If you are concerned you will "come across wrong," *the problem is you.*
  If you find yourself frequently (or even infrequently) in this position,
  change the way you communicate.
* Stop "[wikilawyering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikilawyering)."
  Communicate clearly. Be unambiguous. Say what you mean. Ask for what you want.
  Not doing so leads people to carve off "silos" and "fiefdoms" to "protect"
  themselves or their cohort from other people who purport to speak from
  authority. The less authority is invoked, the more comfortable people will be
  speaking frankly, or indeed at all. More comfort leads to more openness.
  &hellip;which leads to less secrecy.
