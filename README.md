Secrecy is Bad
---
This is a collection of documents describing the ways in which secrecy is bad
for teams, organisations, and states. The documents are:

* Casual - the process/policy of "casual" and "inadvertent" secrecy ("I don't
  see the harm in it")
* Abuse  - how secrecy enables abusers
* Human Resources - one of the holiest shrines of secrecy, Human Resources (HR)
  is often a box of secret-by-default; however, very little of what HR actually
  *does* requires secrect. In fact, the opposite is true.
* States - states claim broad powers of secrecy with very little justification.
* Propagation - secrecy *propagates* secrecy
