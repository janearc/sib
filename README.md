Secrecy is Bad
---
This is a collection of documents describing the ways in which secrecy is bad
for teams, organisations, and states. The documents are:

* [Short](Short.md) - a very quick "reducing casual secrecy" guide.
* [Casual](Casual.md) - the process/policy of "casual" and "inadvertent" secrecy
  ("I don't see the harm in it")
* [Abuse](Abuse.md) - how secrecy enables abusers
* [Human Resources](Human Resources.md) - one of the holiest shrines of secrecy,
  Human Resources (HR) is often a box of secret-by-default; however, very little
  of what HR actually *does* requires secrecy. In fact, the opposite is true.
* [States](States.md) - states claim broad powers of secrecy with very little justification.
* [Propagation](Propagation.md) - secrecy *propagates* secrecy
* [Corruption](Corruption.md) - secrecy corrupts.
